**DAO-GP Drift Aware Online Non-Linear Regression Gaussian-Process**

**DAO-GP Architecture:**
The DAO-GP framework is engineered for superior performance in non-stationary data streams, seamlessly integrating four critical components to ensure robust adaptability. At its core, the **Online Gaussian Process (GP) Regression Engine** continuously updates its predictive function with each new data instance, with adaptation intrinsically tied to real-time concept drift assessment. This is complemented by a **Memory-Based Online Drift Detection and Magnitude Quantification** mechanism, which monitors and records performance indicators (KPIs) of incoming data, proactively identifying concept drift and categorizing its severity. A sophisticated **Hyperparameters Optimization** component dynamically refines the GPâ€™s predictive accuracy by optimizing hyperparameters using the Negative Log Marginal Likelihood (NLML). Finally, a **Dynamic Kernel Pool for Adaptive Selection** enables DAO-GP to select the most appropriate kernel from a predefined set, ensuring responsiveness and robust adaptation to even the most severe distributional shifts. The synergistic interplay of these components is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:DAO-GP-Components-And-WorkFlow}.
